## What I Learned

- Use npm to install and manage packages such as Webpack
- Use Webpack to bundle different JavaScript Modules and other assets such as images and fonts
- Dynamically generate the entire web page's DOM elements using JavaScript

## What To Improve

- Make the site responsive and mobile friendly
- Improve UI/UX design
- Improve file structure and possibly separate the CSS files into smaller files for each page
